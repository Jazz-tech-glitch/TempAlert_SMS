# TempAlert IoT (SIM800L Version) — Hardware Only

This project is a real-time temperature monitoring system for small animals in cages using a SIM800L GSM modulefor SMS alerts.  
This repository focuses on the hardware design(schematic, PCB, and assembled board).

## Components
- Temperature sensor (MLX90614-GY906-Module)
- Arduino Nano
- SIM800L GSM module
- OLED display
- Transistor (LM7805T)
- Capacitor (470uf)
- Headers and connectors as needed

## Files
- `schematic.pdf` — Circuit diagram including SIM800L connections
- `pcb_layout.pdf` — PCB layout for this version
- `gerber.zip` — PCB fabrication files (if applicable)
- `images/` — Photos of the assembled hardware

## Description
The system is designed to monitor the temperature inside small cages.  
The SIM800L module is intended for sending SMS alerts when temperature thresholds are exceeded.  
This repository documents the hardware design, including PCB layout and component placement.

## Features
- Hardware design for real-time temperature monitoring
- SIM800L GSM module integration
- PCB designed for easy assembly
- Photographs of the assembled prototype included

## Status
- PCB designed and fabricated
- Hardware tested (functionality verified)
